**Account Wallet** is an application that allows you to quickly share accounts on social networks or services.
You can easily access the accounts you need and send the QR code or link through the app. You can also save to your wallet not only accounts, but also personal e-mail or the site you need.

## Future plans


The application will develop gradually, it all depends on free time 🙃

 1. Transfer all accounts to free **rest api**;
 2. Scan QR codes in the app;
 3. Create an account and **save all accounts to a profile**;
 4. Creating and editing a **unique user page** each user can customize the page for themselves, on this page you can specify your favorite accounts, as well as a list of all accounts, a description and other information;
