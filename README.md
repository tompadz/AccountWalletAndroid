## Future plans


The application will develop gradually, it all depends on free time ðŸ™ƒ

 1. Transfer all accounts to free **rest api**;
 2. Scan QR codes in the app;
 3. Create an account and **save all accounts to a profile**;
 4. Creating and editing a **unique user page** each user can customize the page for themselves, on this page you can specify your favorite accounts, as well as a list of all accounts, a description and other information;
